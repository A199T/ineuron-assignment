Basic and important knowledge of Load Balancer

Load Balancer -: This is a service that uniformly distributes the network traffic and workloads 
across multiple servers.
Load Balancer increases the availability and fault tolarance of an application.

Fault tolarance -: It is the ability of a workload to remain operational with zero downtime or
data loss in the event of a disruption.

Types of Load Balancer -:

1. Classic Load Balancer - It provides basic load balancing across multiple Amazon Ec2 instances.
# Distributes the incoming application traffic across EC2 instance in multiple AZs.
# Routes the traffic to healthy instances only.
# Internet and internet facing load balancer.

2. Application Load Balancer - Application load balancing intelligently provide scalability, 
performance and availability.
# Functions at the 7th layer of the OSI model.
# Identify the incoming resource type and directs it to the appropriate server.
# Works on HTTP and HTTPS.
# It is called Intelligent Load Balancer.

3. Network Load Balancer - NLB distributes incoming traffic across multiple targets.
# Function at the 4th layer of OSI model.
# Handles million of requests per second.
# This is used to handling sudden and voilent site traffic.
# Works on TCP, UDP, TLS and supports elastic or static IP.

4. Gateway Load Balancer - It helps you easily deploy, scale, and manage your third party virtual
appliances.
 # Works on 3rd layer of OSI model.

Health Check - Health check is the function that provided by load balancer.
# It ensure only healthy resourse can get the traffic .

Cross Zone Load Balancing - It makes easier to deploy and manage applications that run across 
multiple subnets in different Availability zones.
# Traditioally Load Balancer direct equal of the traffic based on the number of AZs.

For ex. we have 2 AZs and total 7 instances 
AZ1                                       AZ2
we have 5 instance in AZ1 - 50%               we have 2 instance in AZ2 - 50%
      
                 LB will distribute traffic on both AZs 50-50

In that case load balancer will distributes 50-50 traffic on both AZs
Then thier will be heavy load on AZ2 because we have only 2 instance their and they can be
overloaded or they can go down or unhealthy.
   In that scenario we will use Cross Zone Load Balancer .
It will distribute traffic equally among those 7 instances.

AZ1             AZ2
5 instance  -   2 instance
100% load will be distribute among those 7 instance 100/7
Normal load balancer will distribute traffic between AZs where as Cross Zone Load Balancer
will distribute traffic among those registered instance in those AZs.
