 Explain the below AWS Architecture

Load balancer----Web server----Database server

Load Balancer: You can create a load balancer using Nginx too! Basically, you will be passing requests 
to multiple web servers instead of a single one based on an algorithm you select.

Web Server: It can be a simple Apache/Nginx server that will serve the static data and pass scripts 
that require execution to an Application server.

Database Server: You can use any DBMS/RDBMS that allows remote connections. Create a database user
 with allowed remote connections from application server so that application server can query the 
database server and get the information it requires to serve a request.
